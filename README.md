This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`npx create-next-app@latest`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```zsh
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To convert the .gltf file into a .glb file, you can use the [gltfjsx](https://github.com/pmndrs/gltfjsx) tool.

```zsh
npx gltfjsx mode.gltf --transform
```
